A simple add-on for converting a Google spreadsheet table to a LaTeX table or a LaTeX table to a Google Spreadsheet table.<p>

![menu](menu.png)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![sample](sample.png)
<p><b> Description:</b></p><br> 

It is rather painful to migrate information from a spreadsheet table to LaTeX or restore a spreadsheet table from LaTeX.  
Spread-LaTeX add-on is built to solve this problem. It simply contains two functions: 
convert a selected Google Spreadsheet table to a LaTeX table and convert a LaTeX table to a Google Spreadsheet table.<p>

====================<b><i> How to use Spread-LaTeX? </i></b>=====================<br>
Click <a href="https://youtu.be/60UTvTIES2E">here</a> for the youtube video. <br>
Install the add-on:<br> 
(1) open a Google Spreadsheet, <br>
(2) click "Add-ons" ---> "Get add-ons" ---> search "Spread-LaTeX" and install. <br>

Convert a spreadsheet table to LaTeX: <br>
(1) select a table in a Google Spreadsheet, <br> 
(2) click "Add-ons" ---> "Spread-LaTeX" ---> "Convert sheet->LaTeX", <br> 
(3) a window will popup, type in the total number of rows for column names and click "OK", <br> 
(4) select all the generated LaTeX code (e.g. Ctrl + A) and copy (e.g. Ctrl + C). <br>

Convert a LaTeX table to a spreadsheet table:<br>
(1) copy the LaTeX code between \toprule and \bottomrule of a table and paste it to any place in a Google spreadsheet,<br> 
(2) click "Add-ons" ---> "Spread-LaTeX" ---> "Convert LaTeX->sheet",<br> 
<b><i>\*Errors may occur if the LaTeX table was not generated by Spread-LaTeX.</i></b> 

=========================<b><i> Settings </b></i>===========================</br>

(1) Package {booktabs} is used for borders. <br>
(2) Package {xcolor} is used for cell colours. <br>
(3) Package {soul} is used for underlines. <br>
(3) Environments {tabular} and {table} are used. <br>
(4) Each "%" is replaced with "\\%". Each"\_" is replaced with "\\_" only if there is no "$" in the cell. 
The rest special LaTeX chars remains intact, given that they may not be plain text. 
For example, $x$ may be a mathematical notation.<br> 
(5) For the purpose of simplicity, this add-on only reads the following information from a spreadsheet table: 
<i> the data, data formats, highlights, font weights, underlines and merged ranges.</i><br> 
(6) Tables’ configurations such as alignments and borders are generated via the code using a default setting.<br>
\==================================================================

I enthusiastically welcome suggestions.
